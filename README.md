COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, exploring trends in cases and deaths across different countries. The project utilizes pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization to derive meaningful insights from global pandemic data.
Dataset
The analysis is based on a COVID-19 dataset containing information about:

Daily and total case counts
Daily and total death counts
Country-specific data (location)
Temporal data (dates)

Project Structure

covid_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all analysis code and visualizations
coviddataset.crdownload: Source dataset (CSV format)
Additional resources and outputs

Features
This analysis includes:
Data Preprocessing

Loading and initial exploration of the COVID-19 dataset
Data cleaning and handling of missing values
Data type conversion and preparation for analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis

Summary statistics of key COVID-19 metrics
Country-wise aggregation of case counts
Temporal trend analysis

Visualizations

Line Chart: Daily new COVID-19 cases in the United States over time
Bar Chart: Top 10 countries by average daily new cases
Histogram: Distribution of daily new COVID-19 cases (with density plot)
Scatter Plot: Relationship between total cases and total deaths

Technologies Used

Python 3: Core programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment

Key Insights
The analysis reveals:

Patterns in COVID-19 spread across different countries
Temporal trends showing waves of infection
Relationships between case counts and mortality
Countries most affected by the pandemic based on average daily cases
